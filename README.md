# sonar_driver_oculus_test2
ROS 2 sonar driver for the blueprint subsea oculus M3000d dual-frequency multi-beam imaging sonar

Original code taken from [jake3991/Argonaut](https://github.com/jake3991/Argonaut/tree/master/sonar_oculus), here updated for ROS2 and a new Oculus Sonar model.

This is currently under development ... Still NOT working properly.
